# RPGClasses
A mod for Terraria that adds RPG-style classes to the game, with a new keybind for an Active Ability unique to each class.

Instead of gaining Experience like in many RPGs, you level up when you defeat a (Vanilla Terraria) boss, which keeps your player power in line with the part of the game you're at.

However, with the way this mod is implemented, it is highly compatible with other mods that use an Experience mechanic, if you want to try using both! (Be careful; your character may end up way too strong in mid and/or late Hardmode like this. If that's the case, try installing difficulty increasing mods.)

There's nothing you need to craft to get started. The mod will automatically give you the appropriate class selection items if you start up a world and have not yet selected a class.

A full description of classes, their passive traits, and their Active Abilities can be found at the forum thread: https://forums.terraria.org/index.php?threads/class-based-rpg-mod.43901/
